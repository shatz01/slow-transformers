# 🐌 slow-transformers

Our motto: "Go transformers! But dont go too fast. You still have to enjoy life ☮️"

> **Diffability**, _noun_
> 
> A principle underscoring the art of unmasking subtle divergences amidst complex similarities, diffability illuminates clear paths through intellectual labyrinths, providing clarity in a sea of cerebral complexity
> ... In practical terms: Understand the difference between two methods by diffing their code them in vscode.
